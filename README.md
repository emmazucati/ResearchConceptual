# ResearchConceptual
Scaled down version of my 2019 summer undergraduate research on data security.
Developed to understand Java classes used as well as sandboxing and taint labeling.
Focused mainly on manipulating Permissions for different classes by making a child of the Java Policy class.
Eventually scaled back up to Apache Storm code base.
